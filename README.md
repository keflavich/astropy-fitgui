Fit GUI for astropy.models
--------------------------

To do:

 * generalize to all models (right now only works with 1D gaussian)
 * add sliders or other interactive cursor-based means of adjusting parameters
 * instructions & docs...
 * test for fixed parameters, etc.
 * deal with higher-dimensional models (e.g., WCS fitting - one of the key use cases to replace IRAF's fitcoords)
    * would be nice to show residuals as vector fields in this particular case
 * expose the matplotlib plotting tools within FitGui so that users can modify appearance of plots
